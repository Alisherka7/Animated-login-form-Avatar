# Animated-login-form-Avatar

Made an animated SVG login avatar. I've seen a couple of these recently, but both were pre-illustrated and rendered frame-by-frame animations synced to the email input. I wanted to make one with live animations since it's a challenge to simulate the perspective and angles in real-time. Took a little brushing up on my trigonometry, but came up with a pretty believable solution.<br><br><hr align align="center" with="75%">
